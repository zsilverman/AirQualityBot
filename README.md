# AirQualityBot
Text bot for air quality index using Twilio, Flask, AirVisual API, and Heroku. 
When prompted with "Hi", the bot will respond asking you to enter a city. After you reply,
the bot will send back the AQI of the location you requested. Send "Hi" again to request 
the AQI of a different city. 

This was my first Flask app built using Python and my first time deploying and hosting. 
The biggest challenge I overcame was learning how to use enviornment variables in my dev and production enviornment.
The Twilio tutorials helped a ton for using Twilio Programmable SMS. 
In the future, I want to add a subscriber feature for text alerts to automaticaly send on days with unhealthy air quality.
Living in California during this past fire season gave me the idea for this use of Twilio services. 

## Try it out for yourself: 
Text `Hi` or `Hello` to (415)449-8470.
