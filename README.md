# AirQualityBot
Text bot for air quality index using Twilio, Flask, AirVisual API, and Heroku. 
When prompted with "Hi", the bot will respond asking you to enter a city. After you reply,
the bot will send back the AQI of the location you requested. Send "Hi" again to request 
the AQI of a different city. 

This was my first Flask app built using Python and my first time deploying and hosting. 
The biggest challenge I overcame was using enviornment variables. The Twilio tutorials helped a ton!
In the future, I want to add a subscriber feature for text alerts on days with unhealthy air quality.
Living in California during fire season, this would be very useful. 

## Try it out for yourself: 
Text ``Hi`` to (415)449-8470.
